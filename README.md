# MSR.APO : Image processing algorithms
Basic image processing application in Python3 with Tkinter, Numpy, Matplotlib and OpenCv3.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
